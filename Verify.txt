 -- DEBATE AGAINST RESERVATION SYSTEM IN INDIA --

The act of reserving, keeping back or withholding a special place for someone is defined as reservations. 
The Debate on the Reservation System in India is the most debated topic. The unsettled history of caste-based reservation in India is as old as our Constitution.

Indian Constitution provides reservation for STs, SCs and OBCs in Government Jobs and Education in India for the upliftment of the backward castes. Reservation was meant to be an uplifter for society but turns out that it has become a lifelong process of spoon-feeding.

In this debate on the Reservation system in India let us look into the actual disadvantages of the Reservation System in India.

Right after Independence, many laws were amended to ensure social justice and provide equal opportunities to the most backward people like the Scheduled Castes and Tribes who were the primary victims of untouchability and caste pollution practices.
