My favorite teacher is Rajani mam. She is my class teacher too and takes attendance daily in the morning. She is a strict teacher. She is also very funny and caring in nature. She is very disciplined and punctual. She does her all the works and projects related to the class at right time without getting late. I like her very much as she tries very easy ways to teach us good things.
We enjoy her class. She teaches us English subject. She makes us laugh by telling lots of jokes in between when she teaches. She also guides us very well during any school or inter-school competition of dance, sports, academic, etc. She teaches us to share things in class among our class mates such as lunch or other needed things.
