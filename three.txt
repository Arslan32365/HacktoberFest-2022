We keep pets for pleasure. Pet dogs always want to protect their owners. Pets are very playful with their owners. They can sacrifice themselves for their owners. My pet dog is a pug. It is fawn in colour and has a â€“ small built. We have named it Swigi. It has been with us since last 2 years. I still remember the day me and my sister went to the pet shop with my father to bring it home. I somehow wanted to pet a cat but my elder sister, Riya is almost crazy about dogs and was adamant that we get a dog as a pet.
Other members of my family also believed that keeping a dog as a pet was a better choice and so a cute little one month old pug came home with us that day and became a part of our family. Though everyone in the family takes care of Swigi, my sister is especially particular about its cleanliness, vaccinations and eating habits. We make Swigi bath twice a week. It is actually my favourite time of the week. We take it to the terrace and bathe him with a pipe. We make sure it gets its food on time and goes for stroll twice every day.
