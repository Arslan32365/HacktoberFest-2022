.Trees give us life directly and indirectly as they are source of oxygen production, CO, consumption and source of rain. They are most precious gift to the humanity on the earth from nature. We must be grateful, give honour and preserve it for the wellness of mankind. We should understand importance of trees in our lives and do our best to save trees in order to save life, save environment on the earth and make earth a green earth.

Trees are as valuable as gold that’s why they are called as “Green Gold” on the earth. They are the real source of our health as well as wealth because they give us oxygen, cool air, fruits, spices, vegetables, medicines, water, wood, furniture, shadow, fuel to burn, houses, fodder to animals and other useful things. They consume toxic gases, refresh air and prevent us from the impacts of air pollution.
