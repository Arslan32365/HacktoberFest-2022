Festivals have been made to reinforce strong bonds between families and friends,,,, and Diwali is the best example. Everyone goes home for Diwali and celebrates it with their families. It is a national holiday, so everyone enjoys the festival without worrying about work. It gets more exciting at night because lots of sky-lanterns are released into the air that flies high and lights up the night sky. Diwali teaches us to be patient for good things in life.
